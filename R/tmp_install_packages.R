#' Temporarily install a package in the current R session
#'
#' This function can be useful when a package is necessary to try to answer a question
#' on StackOverflow and you know that you won't need it anymore afterward. It will install
#' one or several packages only for the current R session.
#'
#' The files are downloaded and installed in a temporary directory, and this
#' directory is temporarily added to the library tree within which packages are
#' looked for: (\code{.libPaths}). If you start another R session, the package
#' won't be accessible as it won't be in the library tree anymore, and as the
#' files are installed in a temporary directory they should be deleted upon next
#' reboot (this depends on your operating system).
#'
#' @note
#' You can find alternative functions in the original question and answers on
#' StackOverflow :
